A decentralized team working platform. kickstart on Feb 17, 2021.

Python, Node.js, Zeronet, Bitcoin ...
it's a few keywords we mentioned when we talked it a few days before.
Zeronet involves many concepts and might connect to different systems such as bitcoin, Tor, Internet anonymous accessing... So it's going to be chanllenging

We start from small steps. 
There are 3 concepts that will be our system basics: Humanbeing, Time, Space.
All the 3 concepts would be our basic system elements, and programming Classes/Objects as well.

Every one is occupying a space as big as his/her physical body, 
and certainly one live in Time,
so it's 4 dimensions.

We are going to lay out our system with 3D space, plus extra time dimension, so every one is a small piece in the 4D system, which is inter-connected all the ways.
And we know that it's history before our system, and the future coming to our system.

So, we use all kind of software tools to make it happen, 
start from Python, Javascript, Node.js, Browsers, Browserify, Express.js, Sockio.js, Asynchronized and synchronized processes, DB, SQL, NoSQL...

And we're going to firstly design UI, 
let's tell it straight, a web page design. Because it's simple and good for a team setup. 
Then we setup front-end and back-end development environments,
the team must include engineers and non-engineering friend.
let more friend come to find fun.

How to merge a lot small piece of time and space into a whole history, as small branches join together to a big river?
